%	ABSTRACT
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%However the cultural niche hypothesis argue that it is no the individual cognitive abilities that explain Homo Sapiens adaptive success, but the cultural evolution process that creates the adaptive packages (tools and belief) even beyond the causal understanding of the individuals who use them.

%Humans gradually accumulate information across generations and develop well-adapted tools, beliefs, and practices that are too complex for any single individual to invent during their lifetime even in what seem to be the ``simplest'' foraging societies.

\section*{Abstract}
\justify 

%Skill improvement has long been modeled as a function of individual experience.
In its brief evolutionary history Homo Sapiens has come to occupy a wider range than any other terrestrial vertebrate species.
Our ability to successfully adapt to such a diverse range of habitats is often explained in terms of our cognitive ability~\cite{pinker2010-cognitiveNiche,newell1981-skillAcquisitionAndLawOfPractice}.
In contrast, the cultural niche hypothesis~\cite{boyd2011-culturalNiche} suggests that is the cultural evolution process that creates the adaptive packages (tools and beliefs) even beyond the causal understanding of the individuals who use them.

In order to study humans adaptive success, we set to investigate the effects of social learning strategies over skill acquisition.
We quantify the impact of team play strategies on a online multiplayer game where a variable amount of players can participate in each game, playing individually or in teams.
\emph{``Faithfulness-boost effect''} provides a skill boost during the first games of experience that would be acquired only after thousands of game played.
%A tendency to play team games is associated with a long run skill improvement, and a tendency to play with a same teammate significantly accelerates short-run skill acquisition.


\section*{The game}


% \setlength{\columnsep}{3cm}
% \begin{multicols}{2}
Games were downloaded from \emph{ConquerClub}, a free server that offer RISK like games.
We have 4.4 millions games played between 2006 and 2009. 
Each turn consists of: i) deploy new troops, ii) assault neighboring opponent's regions, and iii) reinforce regions.
%The game environment has four relevant elements: map, status, chat and log.

\section*{Results}

%Practice has long been a major topic, studied as the main factor for skill improvement.
The generalised power law describes all of the practice data~\cite{newell1981-skillAcquisitionAndLawOfPractice}.
\begin{equation}\label{lawOfPractice}
   \text{Skill} = \text{Skill}_0 \cdot \text{Experience}^{\alpha}
\end{equation} 

where $\alpha$ is the learning rate, and Skill$_0$ the skill after the first game.
%A difference of $4$~tsp (TrueSkill points) between two opponents equate to $\sim2/3$ of winning probability. 
%To analyse the law of practice, we split players by their total activity.
%According to the expected, we observe linear log-log learning curves (Fig.~\ref{learningskill_curve}).

\emph{Faithfulness-boost} slope remains significant until 400 games played, when TOB slope reverses its contribution to a significant positive one.

\section*{Methods}

\emph{TrueSkill}~\cite{herbrich2006-trueskill} assumes hidden player performance as $N(p_i;s_i , \beta)$, centred at their skill $s_i$ with constant noise $\beta$.
The game outcome $\bm{o}$ is considered as the true ordering of hidden teams performances, $t_e = \sum_{i\in A_e} p_i$.
A prior belief distribution is used $N(s_i; \widehat{\mu}_i,\widehat{\sigma}_i^2)$.
With $A$ the partition of players and $\bm{o}$ the ordered team index vector, the probability of an outcome (disregarding draws) is $P(\bm{o} \, | \, \bm{t}) = P(t_{\bm{o}_1} > \dots > t_{\bm{o}_{|A|}})$.

\begin{equation}
  P(\bm{s} \, | \, \bm{o}, A) =  \frac{P(\bm{o} \, | \, \bm{s}, A)  P(\bm{s})}{ P(\bm{o} \, | \, A)} = \int \dots \int P(\bm{s},\bm{p},\bm{t} \, | \, \bm{o}, A) \, d\bm{p}\, d\bm{t}
\end{equation}

\section*{Discussion}

%We found a \emph{``faithfulness-boost effect''} that provides a skill boost during the first games of experience that would be acquired only after thousands of games played.
%We propose that the tendency to play team games as well as to play with an stable partner are both indirectly measuring the bond strength that individuals have with her community.
Our hypothesis suggests that sociability is the key underlying learning factor, which fits into the cultural niche hypothesis.
Cultural evolution process can emerge only if individuals are able to fluidly exchange information with the social system.
%Therefore, the ``sociability technologies''~\cite{segato2016-guerraContraLasMujeres} becomes an essential resource that needs to be exploited and properly studied. 
We believe that the natural information processing system that emerges in human communities has computational properties that have been overlooked up to now in artificial intelligence field~\cite{gershman2015-computationalRationality}.
